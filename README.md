# Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website

## Project Goals
In this Codecademy project, I was tasked to build my own club group page that will dynamically respond as I adjust the size of my screen.

## Description
I created a responsive homepage for a Studio Ghibli Club. It was quite challenging to figure out, but through some manipulation of the Inspect tool on Google Chrome, I was able to simulate mobile devices with device mode and therefore, adjust all of the elements on the screen dpeending on the size of the screen. 

## Project Requirements
1. Build a webpage for a local club.
2. Demonstrate many of the responsive design tools I've learned so far.
